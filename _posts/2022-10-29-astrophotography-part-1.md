Recently I've started playing around the astrophotography. Not sure how far I can get, but I'll detail my journey through the hobby here.

_Post image is one of the first results I got in a heavily light polluted area without any special tracking equipment._

**Next**: I need to get some proper Sky tracking equipment to get better results. I'll detail my journey in the next post.
