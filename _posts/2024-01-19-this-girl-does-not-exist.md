The girl in the image below doesn't exist. But can you tell? If you look close enough, maybe a slightly out of shape fingernail? Or a blurry earring? But from the distance... looks pretty real, doesn't it?

> A realistic photo of a girl that looks like Elsa, wearing an elegant blue dress. She has long blonde hair and blue eyes. She is smiling and looking at the camera.

The image above is created using [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-public-release), a deep-learning text to image model.

## Midjourney
Midjourney also excels at generating images of people, but it can get difficult to get photorealistic results in case you're asking for lookalikes of animated characters, or people with very distinct features. It's great for imaginary and fantasy content though. In the case of our "Elsa", results are still pretty decent, however they still have some of that "dreamy" look to them.

## DALL-E 3
In the case of DALL-E, I've had the far worst results out of all three. It's next to impossible to get a realistic looking person out of it. It's great for generating objects, but not so much for people. I've tried generating a few images of Elsa, but they all look like a weird amalgamation of the character and a human. It's not a bad result, but it's not what I was looking for... also, it's often funny to see what it comes up with given all the content restrictions in ChatGPT-4.
