It's been almost a year since my last blog update on this topic and I've made some progress. I've got a new camera and a Sky tracking mount. Sadly I still live at the same place which is heavily light polluted (Bortle 7), but I've managed to get some decent results by traveling a bit further north.

Not using any special filters this time either, which made it even more challenging. I'm still using the old Sigma 80-400 lens (in all honesty - not very good as it's very dated at this point). I've got more modern stuff as well but none have the necessary reach for deep-sky objects.

_Below is the image I've taken with this setup._

**Setup**:
- Canon R6 + Sigma 80-500mm lens
- Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer GTi
- 100x 30s exposures @ 400mm, ISO 3200
- No dark/bias/flat frames (I know, I know...)

**Processing**:
- Stacked in DeepSkyStacker
- Processed in Siril (Background extraction, Color corrections, initial stretch)
- Processed in Photoshop (Curves, Levels, Color corrections, Noise reduction, Sharpening)

**Next**: I need to think about getting that Telescope...
