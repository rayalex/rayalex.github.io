Recently I [published a blog on the topic of Databricks Monitoring](https://community.databricks.com/t5/technical-blog/databricks-observability-using-grafana-and-prometheus/ba-p/96849)


There I've described how to monitor Databricks using Prometheus and Grafana. I've also shared a few dashboards that I've created for this purpose. You can find all the source code in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rayalex/spark-databricks-observability-demo).
